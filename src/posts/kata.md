[CodeWars](https://codewars.com) is a fun site for practicing programming skills. Any one can create a "Kata" (challenge) that is essentialy a set of tests for a program. You beat the kata by writing a program that passes all the tests.

CodeWars has a lot of martial arts analogies. Here is my badge after ~6 months of Katas. I am almost at the "black belt" level which would seriously impress 12 year old me--although I have yet to solve a "1 kyu", the most challenging kata.
