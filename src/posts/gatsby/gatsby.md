I just followed Andrew Mead's [Great Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM) and now I have a blog.

Andrew Mead is a Udemy teacher who makes Web Development courses. His Gatsby Bootcamp got me started with a basic blog using the following technologies:

1. [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)
2. [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)
3. [React](https://reactjs.org)
4. [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

I intend to use the blog to write succinct articles about learning, web development, and computer science. One thing I will do shortly is a write up on how this very blog was developed. **TODO** link that post here once it's created.
